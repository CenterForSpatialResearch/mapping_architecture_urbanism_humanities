# Mapping for Architecture, Urbanism, and the Humanities
Class resources for the Spring 2020 seminar Mapping for Architecture, Urbanism, and the Humanities

The following tutorials are designed to introduce students to techniques of spatial research and critical cartographic practices. Through a combination of in class instruction and tutorial exercises completed at home students will develop basic fluencies with open source mapping tools. With support from module instructors, students will apply these newly acquired skills to topics and questions of interest through their final projects for the seminar. 

**[Installation](01_QGIS.md)**  
Instructions for downloading and installing QGIS.

**[Mapping Data](02_PopulationMap.md)**  
With this exercise, you will learn introductory skills involved in using QGIS to map existing spatial datasets.

**[Making Data](03_MakingData.md)**  
In this tutorial, you will download 311 data for New York City and learn how to create a categorical and a quantitative map of these data and join it with other spatial datasets.

**[Census Data](04_CensusData.md)**
This tutorial will guide you through the process of downloading both census data and its geographical, bringing them both into QGIS and joining them, and properly symbolizing the result.

**[Analyzing Data](05_AnalysisTools.md)**
Through this exercise you will learn key tools of analysis using QGIS. After completing these exercises you will be able to use proximity based measures, understand the principles and applications of boolean operations, and perform basic raster math operations.

**[Working with Projections](06_Projections.md)**
Projections enable us to represent the earth on a flat surface. This tutorial will walk through the process of creating a U.S. population density map in the Albers equal-area conic projection, a standard way of representing the United States with minimal distortion.

**[Georeferencing](07_Georeferencing.md)**
In this exercise, you will explore some of the georeferencing tools available in QGIS and use them to georeference a 1909 map of Mumbai, "Island of Bombay". You will learn how to use GIS tools to georectify raster datasets and use the georeferenced map to digitize vector features from the map infomation.

**[Web Mapping 01](08_WebMapping1.md)**  
This module will introduce webmaps using Mapbox GL JS. This tutorial will introduce basic setup for making a webmap including basic elements of development for a web browser. 

**[Web Mapping 02](09_WebMapping2.md)**  
In this tutorial, you will create a tileset using external data (rat sightings in NYC) and produce a location-aware heatmap.

**[Web Mapping 03](10_WebMapping2.md)**  
In this tutorial, you will use the sensing capacity of your mobile phone to make GPS drawings.
