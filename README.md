# Mapping for Architecture, Urbanism, and the Humanities

* Columbia University | GSAPP and A&S | Fall 2017
* ARCHA4122_01_2017_3

* Teaching Assistant: Buck Wanner (brw2103)

## Description

We are in the midst of a technological revolution, resulting in seemingly endless amounts of data and the computing technologies to analyze and contextualize that data. In response, our relationship to the spaces we inhabit and those that we don't has shifted. We are challenged to make sense of spaces we have never visited, analyze data we did not collect and bring together people and ideas that have never met. As these forces propel us towards increased global awareness, we must remain critical of the tools and technologies that we use to represent, visualize, and analyze the world. 

This course provides an introduction to critical mapping theory and geographic information systems tools. Of particular interest to Humanities students, this course seeks to address both historical and contemporary questions with reference to space and mapping. Through the use of open-source GIS software (qGIS) and open data (OpenStreetMap) students will learn how to critically use mapping tools and geographic data for spatial analysis and representation. In addition to using existing data, students will also be able to create or bring their own sets of data and questions from other courses and will be able to work with these in our class. 

Using a hybrid flipped-classroom/seminar approach, students will work through web tutorials and hands-on in-class exercises to gain a better understanding of how these tools and data can be leveraged to analyze, represent and study past or present urban phenomena.

## Objectives

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

* Employ best practices for visual communication of spatial information
* Critically read a map
* Critically apply mapping theory to spatial projects
* Make intentional design decisions when composing maps for publication
* Decide when to use a static map and when to use a webmap
* Use QGIS to analyze geographic information
* Strategically use maps and layers to tell a story
* Find and clean datasets for use in GIS
* Turn a static map into a webmap

## Grading

30% Individual assignments and tutorials <br>
15% Midterm<br>
15% Map critique<br>
30% Final project<br>
10% White paper

## Course Design
This course is a project-based, hybrid seminar/laboratory. Each meeting will be divided into two sections. In the first half, we will discuss one element of critical cartography based on the readings. In the second half, we will discuss the tutorial and its implications. To get the most out of the sessions, you will need to do the readings and attempt the tutorial in advance. 

## Assignments 
There are weekly assignments that result from the tutorials. These are graded by submission only. You may work alone, in pairs or groups of three. Please submit whatever you have completed via email by Thursday night. You do NOT need to complete it to receive full credit. You do need to have attempted it. If you do not have anything to send, please write a 1 paragraph essay explaining how far you got and what problems you encountered. These will form the basis for the tutorial.

Graded Assignments
* November 3: Midterm
* November 17: Map Critique
* December 8: Final Presentations
* December 15: Final Project & Whitepaper

## Midterm & Final
The Midterm leads to the final. By the midterm, you should have a question or thesis that you want to explore, analyze, or explain using some type of map, broadly defined. This will form the basis of your final project. Projects can be web, digital, or analogue, but must take the viewer through your hypothesis, argument, or story. The final project will be the execution of your research and design. The white paper will discuss the methods you used and decisions you made. Detailed descriptions will be distributed at least three weeks in advance.  

## Readings
Are available on the course [Zotero Library](https://www.zotero.org/groups/1596423/map_arch_urban_hums) and via Canvas. You will receive an invitation, or you can request an invitation if you do not use your uni.
