## Downloading QGIS

We will be using QGIS 2.14 (Essen) which is the most recent Long Term Release of the program. Please download this version of the program. If you donwload a newer version (or are already using an older version), there may be some incompatibitlities with the turtorials, so we suggest installing this version for use in this course.

### Instructions for PC Users
PC users can download QGIS here and follow the instructions provided by the installer:

* for 32 bit: [QGIS 2.14](http://qgis.org/downloads/QGIS-OSGeo4W-2.14.10-1-Setup-x86.exe)
* for 64 bit: [QGIS 2.14](http://qgis.org/downloads/QGIS-OSGeo4W-2.14.10-1-Setup-x86_64.exe)

(To ditermine whether you are running a 64-bit or Windows look under Start Menu > Control Panel > System)

Follow the prompts on the installer and keep all default settings. 

### Instructions for Mac Users
Mac users must install several packages which support QGIS: GDAL, NumPy, matplotlib, and then QGIS. To avoid any confusion we have included instructions here. (Mac users need to be running OS X 10.8 or higher to run QGIS). 

1. Download this installer: [QGIS 2.14 for Mac](http://www.kyngchaos.com/files/software/qgis/QGIS-2.14.10-1.dmg)

2. Once the download has completed, open the QGIS-2.8.4-1.dmg installer. You will see the following:

 You'll notice that the four installer packages included are numbered for the order in which you need to install them. 

3. First select GDAL Complete (circled above). An installer window will open, follow the steps and agree to the terms as prompted. (*If you encounter any security messages see the notes section at the bottom of this page for instructions.*)
 
4. Next install NumPy. Click on the circled icon and again follow the instructions in the installer. Once the NumPy installation is complete do the same with matplotlib, and finally with QGIS. 

5. Once installation is complete QGIS will be in your Applications folder and is now ready to use.

 Within Security and Privacy select the General tab and instruct your machine to "Open Anyway." Note, if you recieved this security message you will have to go through this same process for each of the four pieces of software we are installing.
