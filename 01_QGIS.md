## Downloading QGIS

We will be using QGIS 3.16 ('Hannover') which is the most recent Long Term Release of the program. Please download this version of the program. If you download a newer version (or are already using an older version), there may be some incompatibilities with the tutorials, so we suggest installing this version for use in this course.

### Instructions for PC Users
PC users can download QGIS here and follow the instructions provided by the installer:

* for 32 bit: [QGIS 3.16](https://qgis.org/downloads/QGIS-OSGeo4W-3.16.16-1-Setup-x86.exe)
* for 64 bit: [QGIS 3.16](https://qgis.org/downloads/QGIS-OSGeo4W-3.16.16-1-Setup-x86_64.exe)

(To determine whether you are running a 64-bit on Windows look under Start Menu > Control Panel > System)

Follow the prompts on the installer and keep all default settings. 

### Instructions for Mac Users
Mac users must install several packages which support QGIS: GDAL, NumPy, matplotlib, and then QGIS. To avoid any confusion we have included instructions here. (Mac users need to be running OS High Sierra (10.13) or higher to run QGIS). 

1. Download this installer: [QGIS 3.16 for Mac](https://qgis.org/downloads/macos/qgis-macos-ltr.dmg)

2. Once the download has completed, open the qgis-macos-ltr.dmg installer. Read and accept the Terms & Conditions. You will see the following:

If you have very strict security/firewall settings enabled you might be presented with this following message:
